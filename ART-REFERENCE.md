## 1. Battle of Rivoli — Direct Depictions

These are the most directly relevant to the game. Priority downloads.

### Felix Philippoteaux — "Bataille de Rivoli, 14 janvier 1797"
- **Location**: Musee de l'Armee / Chateau de Versailles
- **Commons**: Search `Philippoteaux Bataille de Rivoli` or browse `Category:Battle of Rivoli`
- **Depicts**: Panoramic battle — French infantry engaging Austrian columns on the Rivoli plateau. Napoleon on horseback directing. Smoke, bayonets, artillery.
- **Game use**: **Title screen background**, battle loading screen, Battle Journal header. Wide horizontal composition works well for banner crops.

### Henri Frederic Schopin — "The Battle of Rivoli"

### Giuseppe Pietro Bagetti — "Vue de la Bataille de Rivoli"
- **Location**: Chateau de Versailles (Bagetti watercolor collection)
- **Commons**: `Category:Paintings by Giuseppe Pietro Bagetti`
- **Depicts**: Detailed topographic watercolor showing troop positions — the plateau, the gorge, the Adige river valley. More cartographic than dramatic.
- **Game use**: **Map screen, terrain reference, camp phase background** showing the battlefield landscape. The gorge detail is especially relevant.

## 2. Italian Campaign Battle Scenes (1796-97)

Broader campaign art. Same era, same armies, same feel.

### Antoine-Jean Gros — "Napoleon at the Battle of Arcole" (1796)
- **Location**: Musee du Louvre / Chateau de Versailles (multiple versions)
- **Commons**: `File:Antoine-Jean_Gros_-_Bonaparte_au_pont_d%27Arcole.jpg`
- **Depicts**: THE iconic image of young Napoleon — gaunt, intense, clutching the tricolor on the bridge at Arcole. Long hair, thin face, burning eyes. Age 27. No imperial pomp.
- **Game use**: **Title screen, Napoleon NPC portrait, Bonaparte camp event splash.** This is the single most important painting for the game's visual identity. The youth matches your 1797 timeline perfectly.

### Horace Vernet — "Napoleon Crossing the Bridge at Arcole" (1826)
- **Location**: Various
- **Commons**: Search `Vernet Arcole`
- **Depicts**: Wider scene than Gros — shows soldiers following Napoleon across the bridge. More battle context.
- **Game use**: **Banner/panoramic background.** Wider composition works better than Gros's tight portrait for backgrounds.

### Carle Vernet — "Bataille du Pont d'Arcole"
- **Location**: Versailles
- **Commons**: `Category:Battle of Arcole`
- **Depicts**: French troops storming the bridge with bayonets, officers leading from front.
- **Game use**: **Charge sequence art**, battery story beat background.

### Louis-Francois Lejeune — Italian Campaign battle scenes
- **Location**: Versailles, various museums
- **Commons**: `Category:Paintings by Louis-François Lejeune`
- **Depicts**: Large-scale panoramas with incredibly detailed infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Lejeune was a soldier-painter who served in Napoleon's campaigns.
- **Game use**: **Melee phase backgrounds.** Lejeune's work shows individual soldier-level detail — ideal for a game about one soldier's experience.

### Horace Vernet — "Bataille de Jemappes" (1792)
- **Location**: National Gallery, London / Versailles
- **Commons**: `Category:Battle of Jemappes`
- **Depicts**: French Revolutionary infantry in line formation — blue coats, white crossbelts, firing volleys. 1792 uniforms very close to 1797 kit.
- **Game use**: **Volley/Line phase background art.**

> **Commons categories**: `Category:Battle of Arcole`, `Category:Paintings of the French Revolutionary Wars`, `Category:Paintings of Napoleon I in battles`

## 3. Napoleon & French Commanders — Portraits

For NPC portraits and story beat illustrations. **Important**: Use Italian Campaign-era portraits (young general), NOT post-1804 Emperor portraits.

### Napoleon Bonaparte

| Painting | Artist | Notes | Game Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bonaparte at Arcole | Gros (1796) | The defining image — young, intense, tricolor flag | Title screen, NPC portrait |
| Napoleon in Italy | Andrea Appiani (c.1797) | Cleaner, more portrait-like. Profile/three-quarter | Bonaparte camp event portrait |
| Napoleon at Rivoli | Philippoteaux | On horseback directing battle | Gorge story beat (chargeEncounter=3) |
| Arcole sketch/study | Gros | Rougher, grittier than final | Alternative portrait for less idealized feel |

> Avoid: David's "Crossing the Alps", coronation scenes, hand-in-coat portraits — all post-1804.

### Andre Massena
- **Artists**: Gros (attributed), Appiani, various
- **Commons**: `Category:Andre Massena`
- **Depicts**: Strong-featured, dark-haired general. Look for Italian Campaign-era versions (general's uniform, not marshal's).
- **Game use**: **Massena story beat NPC (chargeEncounter=2).** Critical — he has a dedicated encounter.

### Key French Officers

|---|---|---|---|
| Joubert | `Category:Barthélemy Catherine Joubert` | Young general, key position at Rivoli. Fewer portraits exist. | NPC if encountered |

| Murat | `Category:Joachim Murat` | Flamboyant cavalryman. Many portraits (later became King). Use early ones. | NPC portrait |
| Berthier | `Category:Louis-Alexandre Berthier` | Chief of staff. More administrative-looking. | Briefing scenes |
| Augereau | `Category:Charles Pierre Francois Augereau` | Tall, rough-mannered. Portraits by Lefevre. | NPC portrait |

### Austrian Commanders

| Commander | Commons Category | Notes | Game Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alvinczi | `Category:József Alvinczi` | Austrian commander AT Rivoli. Older, white uniform. | Briefing event, enemy reference |

## 5. UI Elements — Textures, Maps & Decorative Art

### Parchment & Paper Textures

| Texture | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Parchment.jpg** | `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Parchment.jpg` | Clean, warm-toned scan. Tileable. |
| **Aged Paper** | Commons → search "aged paper texture" | Foxing, water stains, edge darkening. Grungier variant. |
| **Vellum** | Commons → search "vellum texture" | Animal-skin texture, slight translucency. More "official document" feel. |
| **Period book endpapers** | Biodiversity Heritage Library (biodiversitylibrary.org) | Search French military manuals from the 1790s. Blank endpapers = authentic period aging. Crop for seamless tiling. |

- **Game use**: Layer over existing `--parchment-bg` with `background-blend-mode: multiply`. UI panels, dialogue boxes, Battle Journal backdrop.

### Period Maps of Northern Italy
- **David Rumsey Collection** (davidrumsey.com): Search "Italy 1797", "Rivoli", "Verona"
- **Gallica**: Search "carte Italie 1796" or "campagne Italie"

- **Depicts**: Period tactical maps showing French and Austrian positions around the Rivoli plateau.
- **Game use**: Briefing event illustration, Battle Journal map page.

### Decorative Elements from Period Documents

#### Assignat Currency Notes (1790s)
- **Commons**: Search "assignat 1793" — high-res scans of 5, 10, 50, 100 livres notes
- **Why**: French Revolutionary currency has incredibly detailed engraved borders, neoclassical vignettes, and period typography. Corner ornaments and guilloche patterns are perfect for framing UI panels.
- **Game use**: Extract border ornaments for panel frames. Typography style (Didot-style serifs + copperplate script) complements your EB Garamond.

#### Declaration of the Rights of Man (1789 broadsheet)
- **Commons**: `File:Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_in_1789.jpg`
- **Why**: Ornate neoclassical borders with fasces, Phrygian caps, laurel wreaths, columns.
- **Game use**: Extract border ornaments for parchment overlay frames.

#### Revolutionary-era Printed Decrees
- **Commons**: Search "Republique Francaise decree 1797"
- **Why**: Directory-period (1795-1799) documents have standardized header ornaments with Republic motto, fasces, level symbols.
- **Game use**: Header format (centered title + horizontal rule ornaments) maps to `.cinematic-title` / `.cinematic-subtitle` layout.

#### Trophy-of-Arms Engravings
- **Commons**: Search "trophy of arms engraving" or "trophee d'armes gravure"
- **Why**: THE quintessential Napoleonic decorative element — crossed swords, drums, flags, cannon, laurels.
- **Game use**: Title screen background vignette, header decoration. Rendered in your gold (`--accent-gold: #b8963e`) at low opacity = extremely effective.

### Regimental Standards & Insignia

| Item | Where | Game Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Tricolor cockade (SVG)** | `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cocarde_tricolore.svg` | Player status icon, header decoration, portrait badge. Infinitely scalable. |
| **Demi-brigade flags** | Commons → search "drapeau demi-brigade" or "drapeau 14e demi-brigade" | Header banner, camp phase decoration |
| **Phrygian cap / Liberty cap** | `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bonnet_phrygien.svg` | Small decorative element in headers |
| **Fasces** | Commons → search "fasces SVG" | Vertical decorative elements flanking panel borders |
| **"Armee d'Italie" insignia** | Commons → search "Armee d'Italie" | Title screen or battle phase header |

### Engraved Vignettes

#### "Victoires et Conquetes des Francais" (1817-1825)
- **Internet Archive**: Search "victoires conquetes francais"
- **Why**: Major series documenting French military victories. Each chapter has copperplate headpiece engravings (weapons, flags, drums, laurels in allegorical arrangements) and battle scene vignettes.
- **Game use**: Section dividers, story beat illustrations, Battle Journal decorations.

#### BHL Flickr Stream (Pre-Extracted Illustrations)
- **URL**: flickr.com/photos/biodivlibrary/
- **Why**: Already cropped from source pages — immediately usable. Period book headpieces (bandeaux), tailpieces (culs-de-lampe), and printer's ornaments (fleurons).
- **Game use**: Headpieces as section dividers. Tailpieces as story beat endings. Fleurons as bullet points.

#### Met Prints & Drawings (CC0)
- **Search**: metmuseum.org → "french military engraving" filtered to Open Access, 1800-1900
- **Why**: Percier and Fontaine ornamental designs (Napoleon's official architects), military trophy arrangements, neoclassical panels. All CC0.
- **Game use**: Border designs, decorative panels, period-authentic UI framing.

### Typography Note
Your EB Garamond is already period-appropriate. For even more authenticity, consider **GLC Didot** (free font) — based on Firmin Didot's types, THE French typeface of the 1790s-1800s. Napoleon's official documents used Didot. High-contrast hairline serifs that scream "French Republic" — ideal for titles and headers.

### CSS Integration Quick Reference

**Parchment overlays** (`.camp-event-content`):
```css
background: var(--parchment-bg);
background-image: url('/assets/textures/parchment.jpg');
background-size: cover;
background-blend-mode: multiply;
```

**Dark backgrounds with subtle map** (`.cinematic-overlay`):
```css
/* Very faint map texture for depth */
background-image: url('/assets/maps/rivoli-battle.jpg');
opacity: 0.03-0.05;
filter: sepia(0.3) brightness(0.3);
mix-blend-mode: screen;
```

**Color treatment for dark theme**:
- Desaturate to grayscale
- Reduce opacity to 3-10%
- Apply `mix-blend-mode: screen` or `soft-light`
- Use `filter: sepia(0.3) brightness(0.3)` to match warm gold palette

**Quick-start checklist** (highest impact, lowest effort):
1. Tricolor cockade SVG (one file, instant UI icon)
2. Parchment texture for camp overlays (one image, one CSS rule)
3. Battle of Rivoli map as faint background (atmospheric, low effort)
4. Trophy-of-arms vignette for title screen (strong period flavor)
5. Assignat border ornaments as SVG corners (transforms UI into unmistakably 1790s French)
