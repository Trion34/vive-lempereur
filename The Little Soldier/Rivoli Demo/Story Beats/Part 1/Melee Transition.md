# Melee Transition — Fix Bayonets

**Type:** Story beat (chargeEncounter=6)
**Trigger:** After Volley 4 (end of Line Part 1), before Terrain Melee

---

## Narrative
The last volley tears through the Austrian ranks at twenty-five paces. Point blank. The smoke has barely cleared when the drums change their beat — The pas de charge.

Bayonets rasp from scabbards up and down the line. Steel clicks onto muzzles. Your musket becomes a spear.

Pierre, blood soaking through his sleeve, fixes his bayonet one-handed. His teeth are clenched. His eyes are steady. The veteran has been here before.

Jean-Baptiste fixes his bayonet. His hands shake — but he does it. 

And then the left flank crumbles. You see it happen — white coats pouring through the gap where the companies to your left were standing a moment ago. The ordered line dissolves. Walled gardens and vineyard terraces become individual battlefields. The 14th is no longer a firing line.

It is a collection of men with bayonets, standing in the broken ground of Rivoli, about to fight for their lives.

Captain Leclerc's voice, one final time: 'FOURTEENTH! EN AVANT!'

## Choice
### Fix Bayonets
*"Steel on steel."*

You fix your bayonet. The steel slides home with a click.

The Austrian column hits the French line. Men crash into men across the broken ground. Musket butts, bayonets, fists, teeth. The 14th fights in the vineyards, among the stone walls and the bloody fresh corpses of the fallen.

You are in it now. No more volleys. Just the weight of the man in front of you, the point of your bayonet, the will to survive.

**Melee Event:**

> The ordered line is gone. This is knives and teeth and the will to survive in the vineyards of Rivoli.

## Notes
- NCO is always down at this point (Wounded Sergeant fires after Volley 2)
- Pierre is always wounded (scripted Volley 3 event grazes his shoulder)
- Jean-Baptiste is always alive and unwounded
- No dynamic NPC branching needed — all states are deterministic
