## Dynamic NPC Status

### Pierre (alive)
Pierre leans against a broken wall, his shoulder bound with a strip torn from someone's coat. The blood has soaked through. He catches your eye and nods once. Still here.

### Pierre (dead)
Pierre's place in the line is empty. You don't look at the spot where he fell.

### Jean-Baptiste (alive)
Jean-Baptiste is pale but upright. He checks his flint with hands that barely shake anymore. He's become a soldier. 

### Jean-Baptiste (dead)
Jean-Baptiste's place is empty. You do not let yourself think about it.

## Main Narrative
The sound comes from the south — drums. Not Austrian drums. French drums, beating the pas de charge, growing louder. Through the haze of powder smoke, you see them: fresh troops in blue coats, formed lines, bayonets glinting. Thousands of them.

Masséna's division slams into the Austrian flank like a fist. The columns that have been pressing the plateau stagger, turn, try to reform against this new threat. For the first time since dawn, the pressure on the 14th eases.

*[Pierre Status]*

*[Jean-Baptiste Status]*

Captain Leclerc walks the line. His coat is torn, his face is black with powder, but his voice is steady: 'Five minutes, Fourteenth. Reform. Reload. This isn't over.

Five minutes. What do you do?

## Choices

### Tend Your Wounds
*"Bind your cuts, drink water, catch your breath. You need your body to hold together for what's coming."*

You find a wall and lean against it. The stone is cold. Good. You tear a strip from a dead man's shirt — no time for squeamishness — and bind the worst of it.

The water in your canteen is restorative. You drink deeply and feel better, just a little.

Five minutes. A small blessing.

### Check on Your Comrades
*"Find Pierre and Jean-Baptiste. See who's still standing. The line needs its people more than its muskets."*

**Pierre (alive):**
You find Pierre first. He's binding his own shoulder, one-handed, teeth gripping the bandage end. You kneel and help. He doesn't thank you. He doesn't need to. 'You did well today,' he says quietly. From Pierre, that's a medal.

**Pierre (dead):**
Pierre's place is empty. He wasn't one for words but even so — silence is deafening.

**Jean-Baptiste (alive):**
Jean-Baptiste looks up when you approach. He's afraid — of course he's afraid — but he meets your eyes. 'I won't break,' he says. You believe him. Mostly.

**Jean-Baptiste (dead):**
You look for Jean-Baptiste. You already know. He's gone.

### Follow the Screaming
*"Someone is hurt. You can hear it. Your feet are already moving."*

Intelligence check.

**Success:**
You follow the sound. A surgeon's mate is crouched over a man in the dirt. Blood everywhere. The wounded soldier is thrashing, screaming.

You kneel without being asked. The surgeon's mate doesn't look up. "Hold his leg. Don't let go." You hold it. He cuts. The man screams. You don't let go. "Tourniquet — twist it tighter." You twist. The bleeding slows. The surgeon's mate ties off the stump and moves to the next man without a word.

The soldier is still alive. That's because of you.

**Failure:**
You follow the sound. Between two gun carriages, a surgeon's mate is crouched over a man in the dirt. Blood everywhere. The wounded soldier is thrashing, screaming.

You kneel beside the surgeon's mate. He shoves a tourniquet into your hands. "Above the knee. Tight." Your fingers slip in the blood. You twist it the wrong way. He snatches it back, swearing, does it himself. "Get away."

You stand there with blood on your hands and nothing to show for it.

## Transition
The five minutes are over. Captain Leclerc's voice: 'FOURTEENTH! Form line!'

From the east, through the gorges of the Adige, fresh Austrian columns emerge.  The men who just fought through hell must now fight again.

Masséna's attack bought time. Not victory. The battle is entering its second act.

'Present arms!'
