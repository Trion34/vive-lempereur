## Dynamic NPC Status

### Pierre (alive)
Pierre leans against a gun carriage, his shoulder bound with a strip torn from someone's coat. The blood has soaked through. He catches your eye and nods once. Still here.

### Pierre (dead)
Pierre's place in the line is empty. You don't look at the spot where he fell.

### Jean-Baptiste (alive)
Jean-Baptiste is pale but upright. He checks his flint with hands that barely shake anymore. He's become a soldier. 

### Jean-Baptiste (dead)
Jean-Baptiste's place is empty. You do not let yourself think about it.

## Main Narrative
The sound comes from the south — drums. Not Austrian drums. French drums, beating the pas de charge, growing louder. Through the haze of powder smoke, you see them: fresh troops in blue coats, formed lines, bayonets glinting. Thousands of them.

Masséna's division slams into the Austrian flank like a fist. The columns that have been pressing the plateau stagger, turn, try to reform against this new threat. For the first time since dawn, the pressure on the 14th eases.

*[Pierre Status]*

*[Jean-Baptiste Status]*

Captain Leclerc walks the line. His coat is torn, his face is black with powder, but his voice is steady: 'Five minutes, Fourteenth. Reform. Reload. This isn't over — Vukassovich is coming from the gorges with fresh columns. But we have five minutes. Use them.'

Five minutes. What do you do?

## Choices

### Tend Your Wounds
*"Bind your cuts, drink water, catch your breath. You need your body to hold together for what's coming."*

You find a wall and lean against it. The stone is cold. Good. You tear a strip from a dead man's shirt — no time for squeamishness — and bind the worst of it. Your shoulder. Your side where something grazed you during the melee.

The water in your canteen is lukewarm and tastes of metal. You drink anyway. Your hands stop shaking, just a little.

Five minutes. Not enough. But something.

### Check on Your Comrades
*"Find Pierre and Jean-Baptiste. See who's still standing. The line needs its people more than its muskets."*

**Pierre (alive):**
You find Pierre first. He's binding his own shoulder, one-handed, teeth gripping the bandage end. You kneel and help. He doesn't thank you. He doesn't need to. 'You did well today,' he says quietly. From Pierre, that's a medal.

**Pierre (dead):**
Pierre's place is empty. You stand where he stood this morning and the silence is deafening.

**Jean-Baptiste (alive):**
Jean-Baptiste looks up when you approach. He's afraid — of course he's afraid — but he meets your eyes. 'I won't break,' he says. You believe him. Mostly.

**Jean-Baptiste (dead):**
You look for Jean-Baptiste. You already know. His musket lies where he dropped it at the battery. Someone has set it upright, bayonet-first, in the dirt. A soldier's grave marker.

### Scavenge Ammunition
*"Strip cartridges from the dead. Check your flint. Make sure your musket is ready. Cold and practical."*

You go among the dead. It doesn't bother you the way it should. Fingers find cartridge boxes, pry them open, stuff the paper cylinders into your own pouch. Twenty rounds. Thirty. Enough.

You check your flint. Replace it with a sharper one from a man who won't need it anymore. The musket is clean. Loaded. Ready.

Cold work. Necessary work. The dead don't mind.

## Transition
The five minutes are over. Captain Leclerc's voice: 'FOURTEENTH! Form line! They're coming again!'

From the east, through the gorges of the Adige, fresh Austrian columns emerge — Vukassovich's corps, twenty thousand strong. The men who just fought through hell must now fight again.

Masséna's attack bought time. Not victory. The battle is entering its second act.

'Present arms!'
