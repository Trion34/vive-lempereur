## Context: France at War {#context}

- 1792: Europe plunged into conflict by French Revolution
- France clings on via mass mobilisation and patriotic fervour
- 1795: France occupies Low Countries; Prussia and Spain withdraw
- Coalition enemies remain: Austrian Empire, Kingdoms of Piedmont-Sardinia, Naples, Great Britain
- Counter-revolutionary revolt in the Vendee (western France) — 165,000 dead over 3 years
- France governed by "the Directory" — a moderate five-man committee, reputed corrupt and inefficient
- 1796 plan: Two main armies attack along the Rhine (Jourdan, Moreau). Third effort in Italy — the poor cousin

## Napoleon Takes Command (March 1796) {#takes-command}

**2 March 1796**: Directory appoints Napoleon Bonaparte, one of France's youngest generals, to command the Army of Italy.

**25 March**: Napoleon arrives at HQ in Nice. He is 26 years old.

### Background
- Masterminded French victory at siege of Toulon (1793)
- Short spell as artillery commander in Italy
- Ten days in jail when political patrons fell
- Refused to serve in Vendee — months unemployed in Paris
- 13 Vendemiaire (Oct 1795): Dispersed royalist mob threatening government with "brutal efficiency" — acclaimed "Saviour of the Revolution"
- Promoted to General of Division; awarded command of Army of Italy
- Married Josephine de Beauharnais on 9 March; left for front two days later

### Senior Officers (all later Marshals)
- **Serurier**: Professional soldier, first saw action in Seven Years' War — a decade before Napoleon was born
- **Augereau**: Tough, experienced, bold tactician, committed republican
- **Massena**: Risen from ranks, fearless, tireless, hero of Battle of Loano (1795)
- All three saw Napoleon as young and under-qualified — a political appointment

> *"His small size and puny face did not put him in their favour… but as soon as he donned his general's hat, he seemed to grow by two feet."* — Massena

### Army Organisation
- Massena's Advance Guard (2 divisions: La Harpe, Meynier)
- Main body: Augereau, Serurier, plus smaller divisions (Macquard, Garnier)
- Cavalry led by General Stengel
- Aides-de-camp: Junot, Marmont, Joachim Murat
- Chief of Staff: General Berthier

### Army Condition
- Shockingly neglected by the Directory
- Men hungry and unpaid, some units on verge of mutiny
- Some men lack shoes or muskets
- Napoleon enforces discipline, breaks up rotten units
- Berthier reorganises supply system, scours southern France for food/transport/forage

> Napoleon knows what will rejuvenate his ragged divisions: **victory in battle, and the promise of plunder**.

## Opening Campaign: Montenotte to Mondovi (April 1796) {#opening-campaign}

Napoleon has 38,000 troops — outnumbers Piedmontese and Austrians separately, but not combined.

### Strategic Plan
- Bold, rapid advance on Dego (not expected target Genoa)
- Occupy "the central position" — prise enemies apart
- When threatened: Piedmontese retreat on Turin, Austrians on Milan
- Defeat each in detail
- Allied by fragility of Austro-Piedmontese alliance (deep distrust, years of rivalry)

### Austrian Commander
- General Beaulieu, 70 years old, experienced but doesn't know Italy
- Convinced French will target Genoa — rejects Piedmontese plans for close cooperation
- Allied troops scattered across mountain passes in general defence

### Battle of Montenotte (12 April)
- Beaulieu strikes first at Voltri (10 April) — diversion that plays into Napoleon's hands
- Argenteau's 8,000 at Dego crossroads — dangerously exposed
- Argenteau attacks French at Montenotte as diversion
- **Corporal Rouach** distinguishes himself, exposing himself to fire to shoot down on enemy
- **Colonel Rampon**: "Here, we must conquer or die" — enters French military folklore
- La Harpe reinforces Rampon; Massena makes tough night march across steep ravines in rain and fog
- By dawn: Austrians outnumbered, outflanked, routed

### Battle of Cosseria (13-14 April)
- Augereau's advance held up at old castle held by Piedmontese and Croatian grenadiers
- French launch frontal attacks into withering fire — hundreds of casualties
- Colonel of **18th Demi-Brigade** killed; 26-year-old Louis-Gabriel Suchet takes command
- *"I have never seen fire like it"* — Marmont
- Garrison surrenders next day

### Battle of Dego (14-15 April)
- Under Napoleon's watchful eye, Massena takes Dego
- But while La Harpe's division moves to reinforce Augereau, **hungry French troops left in Dego turn to plunder and pillage**
- **Colonel Vukassovich** (tough Croatian) approaches with 3,000 reinforcements undetected
- Attacks at dawn, routs French, retakes Dego easily
- Requires recall of La Harpe's division and another day of heavy combat
- **Colonel Lannes** (27) leads bayonet charge that wins particular praise from Napoleon

**Napoleon has won three victories in 4 days. Marches and battles gruelling.**

### Pursuit of Piedmontese
- Austrians regrouping at Acqui → retreat to Alessandria. No support to Piedmontese.
- Colli (Piedmontese) withdraws behind Corsaglia River
- Napoleon orders immediate attack: Augereau right, Serurier left, Massena support
- French struggle to cross swollen river with steep banks under heavy fire
- **Serurier's troops enter San Michele and immediately begin looting** — thrown out by counterattack
- Colli withdraws to Mondovi; Napoleon detects fake campfires, launches exhausted troops in pursuit
- General Dichat killed; retreat turns to rout
- French enter Mondovi in triumph — **at last, briefly, they can eat and rest**

### Armistice with Piedmont
- Colli requests armistice; Napoleon declines
- French descend from mountains into fertile Piedmont plain
- **Destitute and starved, French soldiers plunder Italian countryside freely**
- **Brigadier General Joubert**: "Everything would go very well if the soldiers did not abandon themselves to pillage. Not a day passes without some looters being shot. Despite this severity, the mania doesn't stop: the rural folk are arming themselves…"
- Napoleon condemns behaviour but orders have limited impact — Massena and Augereau are two of the greatest offenders
- 25 April: French enter Cherasco, 30 miles from Turin
- Piedmont accepts armistice: gives up Cuneo, Alessandria/Tortona. Final treaty cedes Nice and Savoy to France.
- **Napoleon has ended the four-year war with Piedmont in less than 3 weeks.**

## Crossing the Po & Battle of Lodi (May 1796) {#crossing-po-lodi}

### Crossing the Po (7 May)
- Army receives 7,000 reinforcements and fresh supplies, moves again 4 days after armistice
- Napoleon forms elite brigade: 5,000 grenadiers, carabiniers, chasseurs under General Dallemagne — army's advance guard
- Ordered to march 40 miles in 36 hours to Piacenza
- Massena makes conspicuous fake preparations to cross at Sale (boats, gun batteries)
- **Colonel Lannes** leads the crossing, chasing off Austrian patrols
- Beaulieu completely underestimates scale and speed of Napoleon's move

### Battle of Fombio (8 May)
- Lipthay's Austrians overwhelmed
- That evening: confused night fighting — **General La Harpe shot dead, possibly by friendly fire**
- Napoleon regards him as one of the army's best generals

### Battle of Lodi (10 May)
- French Advance Guard catches Austrian rearguard at Lodi
- 200-yard bridge over River Adda swept by 14 guns, far end held by 3 Croatian infantry battalions
- ~6,500 Austrians total; Napoleon arrives, positions guns for artillery duel
- Sends cavalry upstream to find ford
- Grows impatient — Massena arriving brings strength to 15,000 men, 30 guns
- Napoleon makes speech taunting infantry, daring them to take the bridge
- **"Vive la Republique!"** — hardened 2nd Carabinier battalion leads charge
- Torrential fire from Austrian guns
- Urged on by **Napoleon, Berthier, Massena, Lannes** and others, infantry surge across, under and around the bridge
- Austrian front line crumbles; cavalry across river to north; orderly Austrian withdrawal

### Aftermath
- After Lodi, soldiers give Napoleon nickname: **"le petit caporal"** (the little corporal)
- Term of affection — he gets his hands dirty, even aims guns himself (job of an artillery corporal)
- In just a month: transformed war-weary, dishevelled, demoralised army into victorious fighting force brimming with esprit de corps

## Milan & Lombardy (May-June 1796) {#milan-lombardy}

- 15 May: Napoleon leads army into Milan — welcomed by cheering crowds (though Italians deeply divided)
- Lombardy reorganised as French client-state (Lombardic Republic)
- French demand 20 million francs; troops requisition food, horses, cattle, boots
- Attacks on Catholic church property enrage Italian priests and peasants
- 23 May: Revolt breaks out in Pavia as French set off in pursuit of Austrians; riots in Milan
- At Binasco: Colonel Lannes' grenadiers rout thousand armed rebels, burn village
- *"A terrible example, which will be effective"* — Napoleon
- Pavia retaken; ringleaders (including priests) shot; hundreds of hostages taken

### Reorganisation
- Army now four divisions: Kilmaine's Advance Guard, Augereau, Massena, Serurier
- Beaulieu holds line of Mincio River (Lake Garda to Mantua)
- Famous "Quadrilateral": Peschiera, Verona, Mantua, Legnago

### Crossing the Mincio at Borghetto
- Beaulieu can't read Napoleon's movements, scatters troops
- French find bridge defended by single battalion + handful of hussars
- Austrians driven back; sudden counterattack nearly captures Napoleon himself
- Possibly dramatised: "hopping over fences with one boot on"
- Leads to formation of **Compagnie des Guides a Cheval** — Napoleon's personal cavalry escort
- Commander: young cavalry captain **Jean-Baptiste Bessieres** (later: Chasseurs a Cheval of Imperial Guard)

## First Siege of Mantua & Castiglione (July-Aug 1796) {#first-siege-castiglione}

### Mantua
- Fortress-city: old walls surrounded on three sides by lake, fourth by malarial marshland
- *"The most unhealthy place in Italy"* — Napoleon
- Lacks heavy siege artillery (most in Milan; more intercepted at sea by Commodore Horatio Nelson)
- Since April: three offensives, 200+ miles marched, ten battles won — now brought to a halt
- Must maintain siege, protect communications to France, guard against revolt in Lombardy, face Austrian reinforcements

### Wurmser's Relief (July 1796)
- New Austrian commander: 72-year-old Field Marshal von Wurmser — courageous cavalryman, vigorous beyond his years
- Divides army into four columns:
  - Two central columns down Adige valley toward Mantua
  - One column (east) — wide flanking march
  - Quosdanovich (west of Lake Garda) — seize Brescia, cut Napoleon's retreat
- Massena attacked, abandons Rivoli, fighting retreat
- Sauret's troops at Salo outnumbered, withdraw
- **Austrians surprise French at Brescia — take army hospital with 2,000 French sick and wounded**
- Josephine nearly captured

### Napoleon's Crisis & Response
- Greatest crisis as army commander — outnumbered, left flank in tatters, possible encirclement
- 31 July: orders Serurier to **abandon siege of Mantua** — 179 guns buried or tipped into marshes
- Spots opportunity: Lake Garda separates Quosdanovich from Wurmser
- Concentrate against Quosdanovich, beat him, then pivot to Wurmser

### Battle of Lonato (3 Aug)
- French retake Brescia, recover supplies/sick/wounded
- Wurmser swings south toward abandoned Mantua — away from Quosdanovich. Gifts Napoleon 24 crucial hours.
- Massena counter-attack led by **32nd Demi-Brigade** — "becoming one of Army of Italy's most feared units"
- **"Bayonets only," Napoleon calls, "and you, 32nd, maintain your glorious reputation."**
- Lead Austrian brigade routed
- **Colonel Junot**, wounded six times, accepts Austrian commander's surrender
- Three lost Austrian battalions stumble into Napoleon's HQ at Lonato and demand surrender
- Napoleon's bluff: loudly orders grenadiers/artillery into position, demands Austrians surrender
- Austrians meekly lay down arms

### Augereau at Castiglione (3 Aug)
- Augereau's division fights aggressive rearguard 15 miles south — keeps Wurmser at bay
- Long day of heroic action against superior force
- *"he saved us that day"* — Napoleon, 12 years later (made Augereau Duke of Castiglione)
- By nightfall, division at breaking point: *"Our soldiers are exhausted from fatigue and hunger. If you don't send me reinforcements, I won't be able to hold out."*

### Battle of Castiglione (5 Aug)
- Austrian army formed up east of Castiglione in two lines
- Napoleon has Massena (north), Augereau (centre), Kilmaine cavalry (south)
- 10,000 more troops converging: Despinois from Brescia, Fiorella from south
- Feigned retreat to lure Wurmser forward and buy time
- Fiorella arrives behind Austrian left flank — Napoleon springs trap
- **Major Marmont** leads battery forward for devastating cannonade on Monte Medolano
- Reserve grenadiers charge with bayonets, sweep Austrians off hill
- 4th and 5th Demi-Brigades storm Solferino heights
- Wurmser goes into shock: *"watched without seeing anything, saying anything, hearing anything. This brave old man, his head covered with white hair, did not think anymore."*
- General retreat across Mincio, covered by cavalry
- **French troops close to collapse** after week of forced marches in stifling heat with little food/drink

## Bassano & the Brenta Valley Pursuit (Sept 1796) {#bassano-brenta}

### Strategic Situation
- Siege of Mantua must restart from scratch — Austrians dragged away guns, demolished siege works
- Summer marshes lethal — Austrian garrison decimated by malaria
- Serurier contracts malaria, returns to France; replaced by General Sahuguet
- **Even Massena asks to be replaced, citing ill health and exhaustion. Napoleon rejects his request.**
- Directory orders Napoleon to attack — breakthrough to Innsbruck, join Moreau, invade Austria

### Wurmser's Plan
- Keep Davidovich defensive in Adige valley
- Lead wide outflanking march via Brenta valley and Bassano to reach Mantua from east
- Link up with garrison; catch Napoleon between two armies

### Battle of Rovereto (4 Sept)
- French push up Adige valley: Massena main, Augereau on tougher mountain route, Vaubois around Lake Garda
- Three French divisions converge on Davidovich's outnumbered force near Rovereto
- General Victor leads main attack straight up road
- French light infantry swarm up valley sides to outflank — **tactic used again and again in narrow passes**
- Austrians driven to Calliano — position should have been impregnable (sheer mountains, valley just few hundred yards wide, castle/wall)
- Left to single shaken regiment, given no time to prepare
- Massena's troops breakthrough to main Austrian camp — **soldiers expecting much longer respite are preparing dinner**
- Austrian escape route jammed with fleeing troops, wagons, guns
- French round up 3,000 prisoners, 25 guns, 7 standards

### Brenta Valley Pursuit
- Napoleon learns Wurmser has gone down Brenta valley — tears up plan to join Moreau, orders pursuit
- Army brimming with confidence, marches much faster than Austrians
- Token resistance at Levico
- French light infantry rout 3,000 Austrian rearguard at Primolano, take most prisoner
- **Battle of Bassano**: Colonel Lannes leads charge, Austrians driven back, chased into town by Murat's cavalry
- Amid panic, chaos, blocked roads: 2,000 more prisoners, an Austrian general, 30 guns
- Wurmser down to 12,000 men, outnumbered two-to-one
- Footrace to Mantua — **for first time in campaign, Austrian soldiers outmarch their exhausted French counterparts**
- Massena blocks Austrians at Cerea but General Ott makes determined attack, clears road — 700 French prisoners, 7 guns. Rare defeat for Massena.
- Wurmser reaches Mantua outskirts 13 September — **saved from destruction by skin of his teeth**

## Second Siege of Mantua (Oct 1796) {#second-siege}

- Wurmser bottled up inside Mantua with garrison — intolerable strain on supplies
- **Disease, wounds, malnutrition kill ~100 Austrian soldiers per day for six weeks**
- Civilians eat rats and horses

### Broader War
- Archduke Charles defeats Jourdan twice in two weeks; Moreau retreats to frontier
- Napoleon gets very few reinforcements
- His army exhausted, many sick
- Must contain enormous desperate garrison while facing fresh Austrian offensive

### Alvinczi's Offensive (Oct 1796)
- New Austrian commander: Feldzeugmeister Jozsef Alvinczi (61, Hungarian, former military tutor to Emperor Francis)
- Alvinczi + Quosdanovich: main column (26,000) from Friuli via Bassano to Mantua
- Davidovich's corps (18,000): retake Trento, push south through Adige valley
- Wurmser (12,000 fit men): launch sorties from Mantua to pin French units
- Napoleon outnumbered on every front

### Second Battle of Bassano (6 Nov)
- Heavy rain, swollen rivers, roads to mud
- Vaubois attacks Davidovich but heavily outnumbered, fails
- Napoleon orders Massena and Augereau to attack Austrian crossings of Brenta
- French launch dozens of assaults — Austrian recruits (Grenz battalions, poorly drilled) stand ground and fight hard
- ~3,000 casualties each side — **bloodiest day so far in Italian campaign**
- A failure for Napoleon

### Disaster at Calliano
- During heavy fighting, Croatian troops get behind French line — panic, rout
- Vaubois loses nearly half his division killed, wounded, missing

### Battle of Caldiero (12 Nov) — Napoleon's First Defeat
- Hohenzollern's isolated division too tempting to ignore
- Napoleon orders attacks — conditions atrocious: driving rain, hail, mud
- **Colonel Dupuy's 32nd Demi-Brigade** gets onto ridge around noon
- But Austrian army arrives in force; French outflanked on both wings
- Napoleon retreats to Verona — **unequivocal French defeat, Napoleon's first in battle**

> *"We may be on the verge of losing Italy. None of the expected help has arrived… The Army of Italy, reduced to a handful of men, is worn out… The heroes of Lodi, Millesimo, Castiglione and Bassano have died for their country or are in the hospitals. The men have nothing left but their reputation and their pride… We are abandoned in the depths of Italy."* — Napoleon to the Directory

## Arcole (15-17 Nov 1796) {#arcole}

### Napoleon's Plan
- Leave Macquard to cover Verona
- Circle south, cross Adige, swing north — threaten Alvinczi's lines of communication
- Force Alvinczi to abandon advance

### Day One
- Overnight march; Augereau and Massena arrive undetected at Ronco
- Cross Adige on pontoon bridge, move north
- Marshland on all sides — stuck on narrow raised causeway, 20 yards wide
- Arcole bridge held by two Croatian battalions
- French pinned down on causeway under heavy fire

**Key moments:**
- **Colonel Lannes** discharged himself from hospital that morning to not miss battle. Leads charge, hit in leg.
- **Augereau** grabs a standard: *"Grenadiers! Come and seek your colour!"* — none had courage to follow
- **Napoleon himself** draws sabre, picks up standard, runs forward
- **Colonel Muiron** (aide-de-camp) killed beside Napoleon
- **Sulkowski** (Polish aide): *"The soldiers saw him... and none of them imitated him. I was witness to this extraordinary cowardice, and I cannot conceive it."*
- **French infantry refuse to follow their officers** — assault on bridge ends in abject failure
- Austrian counter-attack drives French back; **Napoleon's horse loses footing, he tumbles into swamp, hauled out by aides**
- General Guieu attacks from south, takes Arcole — but ordered to pull back for planned retreat

### Day Two
- 4am report: Vaubois still holds Rivoli, hasn't even been attacked. Napoleon cancels retreat.
- Masséna's skirmishers into marshland; Austrians bunched on causeway make easy targets
- Augereau still can't get close to Arcole — causeway swept by musket fire and canister
- Stalemate. Soldiers camp amid marshes.

### Day Three
- Davidovich finally attacks — Vaubois breaks, Austrians take Rivoli and 1,000 prisoners
- Napoleon must force decision or retreat
- French assemble pontoon bridge over Alpone overnight; Augereau crosses before dawn
- Austrian gunners spot and knock out bridge — only **51st Demi-Brigade** across (advances gamely on Arcole)
- Bloody see-saw battle along causeways; neither side can deploy or gain advantage
- 3pm: French column from Legnago arrives, threatening Austrian flank
- Austrians launch ferocious counterattack across bridge — Brigadier General Robert killed, Augereau's men panic
- **Massena sends in the elite 32nd Demi-Brigade** — sudden counter-attack turns the tide
- Napoleon's ruse: 25 elite escort sweep in from east blowing bugles to feign mass cavalry charge
- Garrison abandons Arcole; Alvinczi retreats east to Montebello

**Three-day battle: messy, bloody, no great tactical flourishes. Napoleon's margin of victory narrow; a third of his army are casualties.**

### Aftermath
- Napoleon marches to reinforce Vaubois; confusion between Alvinczi and Davidovich leads to both retreating
- Wurmser's poorly timed sortie from Mantua costs 800 casualties
- Napoleon's heroic conduct at bridge becomes **sensational personal PR that captivates France** — birth of "the Napoleonic legend"

## Rivoli (14 Jan 1797) {#rivoli}

### Prelude
- January 1797. Troops not paid for weeks, uniforms disintegrating, shoes broken, hungry.
- *"The hospitals lack everything, our wounded are lying on the floors, and in the most horrible state of destitution."*
- Medical care affects morale — troops going into combat want to know they'll be looked after
- Mantua: 9,000 soldiers dead from disease/wounds/malnutrition in 4 months of siege. Survivors on horsemeat; civilians on rats and dogs. Rations run out 27 January.

### Forces
- Napoleon: few reinforcements (7,000 received), weary divisions
- Alvinczi: 14,000 reinforcements, total 44,000 (many Grenz battalions — frontier militia, poorly drilled, short of officers)

### French Dispositions
- **Serurier** covering Mantua garrison (recovered from illness)
- **Augereau** watching the Adige
- **Massena** guarding Verona
- **Joubert** (27, new) commands northern division (replaced sacked Vaubois)
- **Rey** in reserve south of Lake Garda

### Alvinczi's Plan
- Provera and Bajalich: diversion to draw Napoleon's attention east
- Main attack: six columns down Adige Valley to envelop and destroy Joubert at Rivoli
- Wurmser: sorties from Mantua to pin French

### Austrian Planning Failures
- Lusignan's First Column ordered across slopes of Monte Baldo — **wildly optimistic, dreamed up by staff who hadn't seen the terrain**
- Peak over 7,000 feet, deep snow and ice, treacherous paths, no firewood
- Loses 200 men to exhaustion and exposure; forced into wide detour
- Second and Third columns reach French outpost at Ferrara but wait for Lusignan who never appears
- Plan relies on swift bold action but is falling apart 48 hours in

### Joubert's Report
- *"The report I have given you is exact. Be assured, the enemy will make every effort to throw me onto the blockade of Mantua…"*
- Napoleon announces: *"The enemy's plan has been unmasked"*
- Orders: Massena march immediately to reinforce Joubert. Augereau send cavalry/guns. Rey to Castelnuovo. Serurier high alert. Joubert hold Rivoli at any cost.

### Napoleon at Rivoli (midnight)
- Arrives ~midnight, inspects enemy positions with Joubert
- *"The weather had cleared, and the moonlight was superb. I climbed the different heights and observed the lines of enemy fires. They filled the country between the Adige and Lake Garda, and the atmosphere was ablaze with them. One could easily distinguish five camps, each composed of a column."*
- 10,000 French vs 28,000 Austrians (Alvinczi's full force in 6 columns; ~4,000 under Lusignan delayed on Monte Baldo)

### The Battle

**Early morning (4am):**
- General Vial's light infantry advance through darkness, take San Marco chapel
- French push too far — skirmishes break out, heavy fighting at San Marco heights

**Dawn:**
- Austrians attack plateau in force
- 85th Demi-Brigade outflanked and routed by Lipthay's Second Column
- 29th Light forced to retreat
- **14th Demi-Brigade fights tenaciously** — intense infantry battle across broken ground (vineyards, walled gardens), sudden charges, hurried withdrawals, counter charges
- Austrians overrun a French battery. Officer demands: **"Fourteenth! Will you let them take your guns?"**
- **14th mounts ferocious charge, routs Austrians, reclaims battery**

**9am:** Massena's troops arrive, stabilise buckled French line

**Mid-morning crisis:**
- Vukassovich's Sixth Column (far side of Adige) — guns cause havoc at the Pontare
- Reuss's Fifth Column charges up narrow road, storms French entrenchments
- French right wing threatened with encirclement
- Gunfire to southwest: Lusignan's First Column at Affi, poised to cut off French escape
- **French surrounded, outnumbered, under heavy attack from multiple directions**
- Napoleon's staff look anxiously to their commander

**Napoleon's counter-stroke:**
- Remains calm. Knows Alvinczi's centre columns near exhaustion, no cavalry, little artillery.
- Orders Joubert to send every man and gun for counterattack on Reuss
- **General Leclerc** and 21-year-old **Captain Lasalle** charge with entire French cavalry (few hundred horsemen)
- Lead Austrian troops driven back into gorge — **collide with rest of column coming up, cavalry and infantry jammed together**
- Joubert's men pour fire down from ridge
- **Ammunition wagon explodes** — Austrian morale breaks, survivors flood back
- Napoleon turns to exhausted, spread-out Austrian centre
- Sudden appearance of French cavalry + infantry + guns sparks **panic and mass rout**
- Alvinczi joins undignified race to rear

**1pm:** Bulk of Austrian army in headlong retreat

**Lusignan's isolation:**
- Completely isolated, begins fighting withdrawal
- General Rey's brigade arrives in his rear — triggers rout
- Fewer than half of 4,000 men escape

**Result:** French casualties modest. Austrian losses devastating. 5,000 more captured in following days struggling through mountain passes.

### Provera's March on Mantua
- Napoleon races south with Massena's division
- Provera unaware of disaster; pushes on to Mantua, shadowed by Augereau who snaps up rearguard (2,000 prisoners)
- With just 7,000 left, tries to break through French siege lines at San Giorgio — stopped cold
- Coordinated attack with Wurmser at La Favorita
- Napoleon arrives with Massena; Wurmser's starving men forced back into Citadel
- **57th Demi-Brigade** charges into Provera's flank
- Augereau approaching from east — Provera surrenders with entire force

## Fall of Mantua & March on Vienna (Feb-Apr 1797) {#fall-mantua-vienna}

### Mantua Falls (2 Feb 1797)
- Wurmser holds out two more agonising weeks until all food exhausted
- Surrenders: he and escort return to Austria; 16,000 remaining troops become prisoners
- Austrian losses in campaign: staggering 44,000 men
- **After 8 months, the siege is over**
- General Serurier (not Napoleon) takes formal surrender — Napoleon has already departed

### March South
- Napoleon marches south with 9,000 men against the Pope
- General Victor's division sweeps aside Papal forces at Faenza; Ancona taken without fight
- Treaty of Tolentino: Pope gives up Romagna, 30 million francs, 100 works of art

### March on Vienna (10 March)
- 70,000 confident, seasoned troops
- Joubert invades Tyrol; Massena up Piave valley; Napoleon leads bulk on direct road to Vienna
- New Austrian commander: Archduke Charles (25, Emperor's brother, defeated Jourdan and Moreau)
- But not enough troops or time
- Delaying action at Tagliamento River — Bernadotte surrounds 2,000 Austrians
- Massena blocks Austrian retreat at Tarvis — 3,000 more prisoners in three days
- Napoleon's supply lines overextended — continues advancing while proposing peace
- Austrians accept; armistice agreed

### Treaty of Campo Formio (Oct 1797)
- Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) → France
- Venetian Republic divided between France and Austria (end of 1,200-year republic)
- Horses of St. Mark sent to Louvre
- French territories in Italy form Cisalpine Republic — constitution authored by Napoleon

## Soldier Experience & Conditions {#soldier-conditions}

### Physical Hardship
- Start of campaign: hungry, unpaid, some without shoes or muskets
- Forced marches in rain, fog, across steep ravines (Montenotte)
- Elite brigade: 40 miles in 36 hours to cross Po
- Week of forced marches in stifling heat with little food/drink (Castiglione)
- Winter: bitter cold, heavy snow
- January 1797: not paid for weeks, uniforms disintegrating, shoes broken, hungry
- *"The hospitals lack everything, our wounded are lying on the floors"*

### Plunder & Discipline
- After victories, hungry troops plunder freely (Dego, San Michele, countryside)
- Even generals (Massena, Augereau) among greatest offenders
- Looters shot daily — mania doesn't stop
- Rural folk arm themselves against French soldiers
- Villages burned as punishment (Binasco)
- Systematic extraction: 20 million francs from Lombardy, 40 million from Italian states, 30 million from Pope

### Combat Experience
- Brutal frontal assaults against defended positions (Cosseria, Arcole bridge)
- Night marches and dawn attacks
- Bayonet charges decisive at multiple battles
- Soldiers refusing to advance under fire (Arcole — even with Napoleon leading)
- Light infantry flanking tactics in mountain passes
- Confused night fighting (Fombio — friendly fire killed La Harpe)
- Counter-attacks reclaiming lost positions (14th at Rivoli)

### Morale Factors
- Victory and plunder as rejuvenators
- Esprit de corps after Lodi — "le petit caporal" nickname
- Medical care (or lack thereof) affects willingness to fight
- Exhaustion as real factor — divisions at "breaking point" multiple times
- Officers leading from front: Napoleon, Augereau, Lannes personally charging
- Birth of Napoleonic legend at Arcole as morale/propaganda tool

### The 14th at Rivoli (Game-Relevant Detail)
- Intense infantry battle across broken ground: vineyards, walled gardens
- Sudden charges, hurried withdrawals, counter-charges
- Austrians overrun a battery — officer rallies troops: "Fourteenth! Will you let them take your guns?"
- Ferocious charge routs Austrians, reclaims battery
- This is the player's experience in the game
