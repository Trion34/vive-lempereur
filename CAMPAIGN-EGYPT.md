# Campaign 2: Egypt (1798–1801)

*"The army that conquered Italy now sails for Egypt. Napoleon dreams of empire in the East. The men dream of coming home."*

**Scope:** V2.0
**Player arc:** Veteran of Italy → Colonial soldier → Marooned survivor
**Tone:** Alien landscape. Heat, disease, isolation. The army that was invincible in Italy discovers its limits.
**Duration:** 4-5 chapters (TBD)

---

## Key Themes

- **Isolation:** Cut off from France after Nelson destroys the fleet at the Nile
- **Disease:** Plague at Jaffa. The army is decimated not by enemy action but by illness.
- **Alien enemy:** Ottoman and Mamluk forces fight differently from Austrians
- **Moral decay:** Massacres, abandoned sick, Napoleon abandoning his army
- **The return:** Only some make it home. The player might not be one of them.

## Tentative Chapters

| Ch | Title | Battle/Event | Unique Hook |
|----|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | The Pyramids | **Battle of the Pyramids** | Mamluk cavalry charges against infantry squares. New formation mechanic. |
| 2 | The Walls | **Siege of Acre** | Failed siege. The army's first true failure. Disease and despair. |
| 3 | The Plague | **Jaffa** | Plague hospital. Moral choice: mercy killing? Napoleon touches the sick. |
| 4 | The Last Victory | **Aboukir** | The final battle in Egypt. Victory, but Napoleon leaves. |
| 5 | The Return | **Survival** | Surviving the journey home. Not everyone makes it. |

## New Mechanics (Tentative)

- **Heat/thirst system** — Desert warfare adds environmental survival pressure. Water as resource.
- **Infantry square** — New formation for cavalry defense (Pyramids). Different volley variant: firing from a square, cavalry circling.
- **Disease mechanics** — Constitution checks, quarantine decisions. Plague as persistent threat.
- **Naval element** — The fleet's destruction at the Nile (narrated, but impacts morale/supply profoundly).
- **Moral choices** — Jaffa prisoners (historical massacre), plague hospital, abandoned sick. The war's moral cost.
- **New enemy types** — Mamluk cavalry (fast, individual, terrifying charges), Ottoman infantry (different tactics from Austrians), Egyptian irregulars.

## Narrative Arc

Italy was victory. Egypt is hubris.

The army that conquered Italy arrives in Egypt believing itself invincible. The Pyramids seem to confirm this — Mamluk cavalry shattered against disciplined squares. But then Nelson destroys the fleet. The army is marooned. Disease kills more men than combat. The siege of Acre fails. Napoleon himself abandons the army and sails home in secret.

The player's arc mirrors the army's: from confidence to isolation to survival. The question shifts from "can I win?" to "can I get home?"

## Historical Research Needed

- Detailed Pyramids battle account (formation, Mamluk tactics, infantry square experience)
- Siege of Acre timeline (assaults, plague, Smith's defense)
- Jaffa massacre details (prisoner situation, plague hospital, Napoleon's visit)
- Aboukir battle (Murat's charge, final victory)
- Army's condition during Egyptian occupation (heat, disease, supply, morale)
- The return journey (who made it, who didn't, how)
