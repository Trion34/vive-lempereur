# Campaign 3: Russia (1812)

*"600,000 men cross the Niemen. Fewer than 100,000 return. This is the ultimate survival story."*

**Scope:** V3.0
**Player arc:** Old veteran (or new recruit) → The march → Moscow → The retreat → (survival?)
**Tone:** Epic scale collapsing into personal survival. Cold. Hunger. The death of an army.
**Duration:** 4-5 chapters (TBD)

## Key Themes

- **Scale and futility:** The Grande Armee is enormous but it's marching into nothing
- **The empty victory:** Moscow is taken. It's empty. Then it burns.
- **The retreat:** The real game. Survival against cold, hunger, Cossacks, and despair.
- **Endurance:** Everything is about lasting one more day, one more mile
- **The end of the legend:** The army that was invincible dies in the snow

## Tentative Chapters

| Ch | Title | Battle/Event | Unique Hook |
|----|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | The March | **Smolensk** | First major engagement. Russians retreat and burn the city. The frustration of chasing an enemy who won't fight. |
| 2 | The Bloodiest Day | **Borodino** | Massive pitched battle. Redoubts, cavalry charges, artillery hell. The scale dwarfs anything in Italy or Egypt. |
| 3 | The Empty Prize | **Moscow** | Not a battle — the occupation. The fire. The decision to retreat. A chapter without combat. |
| 4 | The Crossing | **Berezina** | River crossing under attack. Bridges collapsing. Panic. The most desperate hour. |
| 5 | The Road Home | **Survival** | Pure survival gameplay. Cold, starvation, Cossack raids. Can you make it? |

## New Mechanics (Tentative)

- **Cold/exposure system** — Temperature as a constant drain, requiring fire, shelter, clothing. Frostbite injuries.
- **Starvation** — Food scarcity as core mechanic, not just flavor. Foraging, horse meat, cannibalism rumors.
- **Cossack raids** — Hit-and-run encounters, ambush mechanics. A new enemy type: fast, evasive, terrifying.
- **Cavalry charges** — Player faces massed cavalry at Borodino. Different from infantry combat.
- **March attrition** — Between-battle losses. Desertion, stragglers, disease. The army shrinks chapter by chapter.
- **Fire mechanic** — Moscow burns. Player must navigate the inferno. Environmental hazard gameplay.
- **The retreat** — Unique game mode. Not a battle, not a camp. A grinding march westward with daily survival decisions.

## Narrative Arc

Italy was glory. Egypt was hubris. Russia is the reckoning.

The Grande Armee is the largest military force ever assembled. 600,000 men cross into Russia. The player — whether an old veteran of Italy and Egypt, or a fresh conscript — marches with them. Smolensk burns. Borodino is a slaughter with no clear winner. Moscow is empty. Then it burns too.

The retreat is the real story. The army disintegrates. Cold, hunger, Cossacks, and despair strip away everything — rank, equipment, discipline, hope. The game shifts from tactical combat to pure survival. Can you cross the Berezina? Can you make it to the Niemen? Can you make it home?

The final question the game asks: was any of it worth it?

## Historical Research Needed

- Detailed Borodino account (the redoubts, Bagration's fleches, Raevsky battery, cavalry charges)
- Smolensk engagement (Russian scorched-earth, the burning city)
- Moscow occupation (the fire, looting, discipline collapse, Napoleon's indecision)
- Berezina crossing (engineering, the bridges, Ney's rearguard, the chaos)
- The retreat timeline (Maloyaroslavets, Smolensk again, daily conditions, what soldiers ate, how they died)
- Cossack and partisan warfare (hit-and-run tactics, prisoner treatment)
- Soldier accounts and memoirs (Bourgogne, Coignet, other ranks' perspectives)
