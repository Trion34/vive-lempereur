## Chapter 1: Baptism of Fire

**Battle: Montenotte** — 12 April 1796
*The army's first engagement under Bonaparte. Nobody knows if this general is real or another political appointment. The men are hungry, unpaid, some without shoes. Then the shooting starts.*

### Historical Context
- Napoleon arrives at Nice, 26 years old, to an army that despises him
- Beaulieu (Austrian, 70) strikes first at Voltri — plays into Napoleon's hands
- Argenteau's 8,000 exposed at the Dego crossroads
- Rampon's legendary stand: "Here, we must conquer or die"
- Massena's night march through ravines in rain and fog
- By dawn: Austrians outnumbered, outflanked, routed

### Battle Structure
- **Unique hook:** The player's first battle. Tutorial-weight. Shorter volley sequence (2-3 volleys). Simpler melee (1-2 opponents). The mechanics teach themselves.
- **Terrain:** Mountain passes, fog, rain. Steep ravines.
- **Volley variant:** Fog reduces visibility — shorter engagement range, lower accuracy for both sides.
- **Melee:** First close combat. 1-2 Austrian conscripts. Forgiving difficulty.
- **Key story beat:** Colonel Rampon's stand — the player witnesses it. "Here, we must conquer or die." Sets the tone for the campaign.
- **Outcome:** Victory. The army's confidence surges. Napoleon proves himself.

### Camp: Before
- **Location:** Camp near Nice
- **Mood:** Demoralized. Hungry. Skeptical of the new general.
- **Key event:** Napoleon's first speech to the troops (heard from the ranks, not the podium)
- **Supplies:** Terrible. No shoes, no pay, barely any food.

### Camp: After
- **Mood:** Cautiously optimistic. First victory.
- **Key event:** Aftermath — counting the dead, looting the field (historically accurate: the army looted freely)
- **Narrative interlude:** Rapid march to Dego, Cosseria (narrated, not played). The army fights three battles in four days. Exhaustion.

### Player Arc
- Raw conscript. Doesn't know how to hold a musket properly.
- Survives first battle. Earns a place in the line.
- Begins forming bonds with squadmates.

## Chapter 2: The Bridge

**Battle: Lodi** — 10 May 1796
*A 200-yard bridge swept by 14 Austrian guns. The far end held by Croatian infantry. Napoleon himself grabs a standard and charges. "Vive la Republique!" The men must follow — or watch their general die.*

### Historical Context
- After crossing the Po (40 miles in 36 hours), French catch Austrian rearguard at Lodi
- 200-yard bridge over the Adda, swept by 14 guns and 3 Croatian battalions
- Napoleon positions guns for artillery duel, sends cavalry upstream for a ford
- Grows impatient — makes speech taunting the infantry, daring them to charge
- 2nd Carabinier battalion leads — "Vive la Republique!"
- Napoleon, Berthier, Massena, Lannes personally on the bridge
- After Lodi, soldiers nickname Napoleon "le petit caporal" — a term of affection

### Battle Structure
- **Unique hook:** The bridge assault. Not a standard line engagement. The player must charge across a bridge under cannon fire. A completely different volley dynamic — no "line" to hold, just a sprint forward.
- **Volley variant:** No firing back during the charge. Pure ENDURE phase — canister and musketry tearing through the column as you run. Morale checks each "step" of the bridge. Very high lethality, very fast.
- **Key mechanic:** **The Charge** — a new auto-play variant. Instead of standing volleys, the player's unit advances under fire. Each phase is a stretch of the bridge. Casualties mount. The question is whether morale holds.
- **Melee:** Brief, chaotic melee at the far end against Croatian infantry. Tight quarters. 2-3 opponents.
- **Key story beat:** Napoleon on the bridge. The player sees him. Does the player push forward or hang back? Valor check with high stakes.
- **Outcome:** Austrian rearguard crumbles. Cavalry arrives from the ford. But the cost is high.

### Camp: Before
- **Location:** South bank of the Adda
- **Mood:** Confident after Montenotte campaign, but exhausted. 40-mile forced march.
- **Key event:** Napoleon's speech before the assault — "Are you going to let those guns stop you?"
- **Supplies:** Improving (looted from victories)

### Camp: After
- **Mood:** Euphoric. Birth of "le petit caporal." The army believes in Napoleon now.
- **Key event:** Soldiers give Napoleon his nickname. The army transforms from rabble to believers.
- **Narrative interlude:** March into Milan. Occupation. Looting. Revolt at Pavia (narrated). The war has a price for the Italians too.

### Player Arc
- No longer a raw recruit. Has survived combat, formed bonds.
- The bridge is a defining moment — courage or survival? The choice echoes.
- Rank opportunity: if the player has distinguished themselves, first chance at Corporal.

## Chapter 3: The Siege

**Battle: Castiglione** — 5 August 1796
*Wurmser's relief army threatens to encircle the French. Augereau holds the line all day with his division at breaking point. "If you don't send me reinforcements, I won't be able to hold out." The player's unit is part of that desperate defense.*

### Historical Context
- Mantua besieged. Wurmser (72, courageous cavalryman) launches relief with 4 columns
- French left flank collapses — Massena retreats from Rivoli, hospital at Brescia captured
- Napoleon's greatest crisis as commander. Outnumbered, possible encirclement
- Abandons siege of Mantua (179 guns buried in marshes)
- Concentrates against Quosdanovich first, then pivots to Wurmser
- Augereau's division fights heroic rearguard action all day against superior force
- At Castiglione: feigned retreat, Fiorella arrives behind Austrian flank, Napoleon springs trap
- Marmont's devastating cannonade. Reserve grenadiers charge Monte Medolano.
- Wurmser goes into shock. General retreat.
- French troops close to collapse after a week of forced marches in stifling heat

### Battle Structure
- **Unique hook:** Defensive battle. The player isn't advancing — they're holding. Wave after wave. The question isn't "can we break them?" but "can we last long enough?"
- **Volley variant:** Extended engagement. More volleys than Rivoli. Lower intensity per volley but grinding attrition. Morale management is the challenge.
- **Key mechanic:** **Reinforcement clock** — Fiorella's column is marching to arrive. The player can see/hear references to reinforcements coming. The battle has a timer: hold until they arrive.
- **Melee:** Desperate defensive melee. Austrian cavalry probes. The player fights from a position, not in open field.
- **Key story beat:** Augereau's stand — the player sees Augereau grab a standard and rally his men. NPC moments: who breaks, who holds.
- **Outcome:** Victory, but at enormous cost. The army is spent.

### Camp: Before
- **Location:** Siege lines around Mantua. Malarial marshes.
- **Mood:** Grinding. The siege is miserable. Disease everywhere.
- **Key event:** Wurmser's approach — the siege abandoned. 179 guns dumped in the marsh. A bitter day.
- **Supplies:** Poor. Siege conditions. Malaria.

### Camp: After
- **Mood:** Relief but exhaustion. Won, but barely.
- **Key event:** Aftermath — the French are close to collapse. Massena himself asks to be replaced, citing exhaustion. Napoleon refuses.
- **Narrative interlude:** Second siege begins. Bassano campaign (narrated). The army pursues Wurmser down the Brenta Valley in a running fight. Exhausting forced marches. Wurmser barely reaches Mantua.

### Player Arc
- Veteran now. Has been through multiple battles. Starting to understand the cost.
- The siege tests endurance, not courage. Can you survive boredom, disease, and grinding work?
- Relationships deepen — or fray. Some NPCs may be sick, wounded, or dead.

## Chapter 4: The Bridge of Death

**Battle: Arcole** — 15–17 November 1796
*Three days on a narrow causeway. Marshland on every side. The bridge is held by Croatian battalions. Assault after assault fails. Napoleon himself charges with a standard — and tumbles into the swamp. Even the bravest men refuse to follow.*

### Historical Context
- Alvinczi's new offensive. Napoleon outnumbered on every front.
- Caldiero: Napoleon's first defeat (narrated before Arcole)
- Overnight march, cross the Adige on pontoon, advance up narrow causeway
- Day 1: Lannes charges (hit in leg), Augereau grabs a standard (no one follows), Napoleon charges (Muiron killed beside him), Napoleon falls in swamp
- Infantry refuse to advance. "I was witness to this extraordinary cowardice." — Sulkowski
- Day 2: Stalemate. Skirmishers in marshes. Can't get close to bridge.
- Day 3: Must force a decision. 51st Demi-Brigade crosses alone. Bloody seesaw. 32nd Demi-Brigade tips the scales. Napoleon's cavalry bugles ruse.
- Three-day battle: messy, bloody, no great tactical flourishes. A third of the army are casualties.

### Battle Structure
- **Unique hook:** Multi-day battle. Three acts within one chapter. The player fights, rests briefly, fights again. Morale and health carry across all three days. Attrition warfare.
- **Day 1:** Assault on the causeway. Intense ENDURE phases under murderous fire. The charge fails. Retreat. This is the first time the player experiences defeat within a battle.
- **Day 2:** Skirmishing in the marshes. Different tone — lower intensity, flanking, individual initiative. Awareness/Intelligence checks for navigating terrain.
- **Day 3:** Final assault. Everything on the line. The bridge must be taken. Most intense combat of the campaign so far.
- **Melee:** Causeway combat — tight, nowhere to run. Croatian opponents (tough, experienced).
- **Key story beat:** Napoleon on the bridge. The player witnesses the general charge and fall. Morale crisis: if Napoleon can fail, what chance do you have?
- **Key story beat 2:** The soldiers refuse to advance. The player's choice: do you go forward alone? Do you rally others? Do you refuse too?
- **Outcome:** Victory, barely. The army is shattered. A third are casualties.

### Camp: Before
- **Location:** Verona. After Caldiero defeat.
- **Mood:** Lowest point of the campaign. First defeat. Exhausted, outnumbered, far from home.
- **Key event:** Napoleon's letter to the Directory — "We are abandoned in the depths of Italy." The player hears rumors of this. Morale is terrible.
- **Supplies:** Threadbare. Winter setting in.

### Camp: After
- **Mood:** Survivor's guilt. Victory, but at what cost? A third of the army gone.
- **Key event:** Napoleon's heroics at Arcole become legendary — birth of the Napoleonic myth. The propaganda machine starts. The player was there. They know what really happened.
- **Narrative interlude:** Quiet months. Winter. The siege continues. The army recovers, barely.

### Player Arc
- This is the crucible. The player has been through everything now.
- The refusal on the bridge is the defining moment — even heroes have limits.
- If the player has shown consistent courage, NPCs now look to them. Possible Sergeant promotion.
- Pierre is an "Arcole veteran" (referenced in Rivoli). This is where that label is earned.

## Chapter 5: The Decisive Day

**Battle: Rivoli** — 14 January 1797 *(DEMO — built)*
*10,000 French vs 28,000 Austrians. Six columns converging on the plateau. Joubert holds by his fingernails until Massena arrives. Napoleon rides through the night. The 14th Demi-Brigade charges to reclaim their guns. "Fourteenth! Will you let them take your guns?"*

## Chapter 6: The Siege Ends

**Battle: Mantua** — February 1797
*Wurmser holds out until all food is exhausted. 16,000 starving men surrender. The siege that has defined the campaign is finally over. But the war isn't done — Napoleon marches on Vienna.*

### Historical Context
- Provera's march to relieve Mantua after Rivoli — surrounded and surrenders
- Wurmser holds out two more agonizing weeks until all food exhausted
- Surrenders with full honors: 16,000 remaining troops become prisoners
- Austrian losses in the entire campaign: 44,000 men
- Napoleon already gone — marches south against the Pope, then toward Vienna
- Archduke Charles (25, Emperor's brother) takes command. Too few troops, too late.
- Armistice. Treaty of Campo Formio.

### Battle Structure
- **Unique hook:** Not a conventional pitched battle. The player's role in the siege's final act. Provera's column approaches — the player's unit must stop the relief force while Wurmser tries to break out from inside. Fighting on two fronts.
- **Key mechanic:** **Two-front defense** — the player faces attacks from Provera's approaching column AND sorties from the Mantua garrison. Switching between positions. Managing exhaustion.
- **Melee:** Austrian garrison troops — starving, desperate, but fighting for their lives. Different enemy type: weak but fanatical.
- **Key story beat:** Wurmser's surrender. The player watches 16,000 walking dead emerge from the fortress. The human cost of siege warfare.
- **Outcome:** Total victory. The Italian Campaign is won. But what does it feel like?

### Camp: After (Campaign Epilogue)
- **Mood:** Victory. Triumph. But also emptiness. What was it all for?
- **Key events:**
  - Treaty of Campo Formio (narrated). Austria capitulates.
  - Napoleon leaves for Paris, then Egypt. The army that won Italy is scattered.
  - The player's journey through Italy is over. What remains? Rank, scars, memories, and the names of the dead.
- **Narrative resolution:** NPC arcs conclude. Pierre (if alive). Jean-Baptiste (if alive). The player's reputation — what did they become? Hero? Survivor? Coward? Leader?

### Player Arc
- Campaign resolution. The arc completes.
- Final rank assessment. Final reputation summary.
- The player carries everything forward to Egypt (if Campaign 2 is unlocked).
