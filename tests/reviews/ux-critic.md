# UI/UX Critic Review — Interface Quality Assessment
## Rating: 7/10

**Outcome:** ongoing

---

## Layout & Visual Hierarchy

- Player panel: 260px | Center: 760px | Enemy: 260px
- Opening narrative: 117 words
- Phase 1 actions available: 2
  - Aim Carefully: Steady your musket. Pick a man. Breathe. This takes nerve — and time.
  - Present Arms: Raise your musket to the shoulder. Standard. Reliable.

## Interactive Feedback

- Phase 1: 12 clicks in 2s
- Phase 2 transition: 0ms
- Phase 2 choices available: 0
- Melee stances: 0 | Actions: 0 | Targets: 0

## Strengths

- Three-column layout balanced: center is 59% of width.
- Opening narrative is substantial: 117 words — sets the scene well.
- 2 actions available initially — manageable, not overwhelming.
- Phase 1 completed in 2s with 12 clicks.

## Issues Found

- Phase 1 took 12 clicks — that's a lot of clicking for a scripted phase. Consider reducing to 3 volleys or making some drill steps automatic.
- Battle ended before Phase 2 — could not evaluate storybook UI.

## Recommendations

1. Phase 1 took 12 clicks
2. Battle ended before Phase 2
