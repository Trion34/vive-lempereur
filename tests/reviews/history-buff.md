## Objections

- No anachronisms found (rare — well done).
- "White coat" count: 0 — acceptable

- **No named Austrian characters.** Every French soldier gets a name and personality (Pierre, Jean-Baptiste, Leclerc, Duval). The Austrians are faceless "white coats." This undermines the historical humanity of the battle. A Feldwebel could be "Feldwebel Gruber" or "a man from the Deutschmeister regiment." Even one named Austrian would add gravitas.

- Sergeant Duval not mentioned in this playthrough — is he only in random events? He should be more present as the NCO backbone.

## Recommendations

1. Give at least one Austrian opponent a name and regimental identity. "Feldwebel Gruber of the IR 29 Lindenau" is infinitely more interesting than "An Austrian Feldwebel."
2. White coat usage is acceptable.
3. Add more period-specific French military terms: "pas de charge" for the advance, "en avant!" as commands, "tirez!" for fire orders.
4. Strengthen winter atmosphere — January on an Italian plateau should feel bitterly cold throughout, not just in the opening.
5. Consider adding a brief historical note in the ending screen: "The Battle of Rivoli, 14 January 1797, was Bonaparte's decisive victory in the Italian campaign..."
