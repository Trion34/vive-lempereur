## Objections

- No anachronisms found (rare — well done).
- **"White coat" appears 19 times.** This descriptor has become a crutch. The Austrians wore white, yes, but constantly repeating "white coat" as their sole identifier reduces them to a costume rather than an army. Vary the description: "the Austrian line", "the enemy ranks", "Habsburg infantry", "the oncoming column".
- **"Bayonet" appears 34 times.** Overused. Use synonyms: "steel", "the point", "cold iron", "the socket blade".




## Recommendations

1. Austrian naming is present — consider adding regimental numbers.
2. Reduce "white coat" frequency (currently 19). Replace half with alternatives: "the Austrian column", "Habsburg troops", "the enemy in white", "their line".
3. Add more period-specific French military terms: "pas de charge" for the advance, "en avant!" as commands, "tirez!" for fire orders.
4. Winter atmosphere is well-maintained.
5. Consider adding a brief historical note in the ending screen: "The Battle of Rivoli, 14 January 1797, was Bonaparte's decisive victory in the Italian campaign..."
