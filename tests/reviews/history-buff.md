## Objections

- No anachronisms found (rare — well done).
- "White coat" count: 5 — acceptable



- Sergeant Duval not mentioned in this playthrough — is he only in random events? He should be more present as the NCO backbone.

## Recommendations

1. Austrian naming is present — consider adding regimental numbers.
2. White coat usage is acceptable.
3. Add more period-specific French military terms: "pas de charge" for the advance, "en avant!" as commands, "tirez!" for fire orders.
4. Winter atmosphere is well-maintained.
5. Consider adding a brief historical note in the ending screen: "The Battle of Rivoli, 14 January 1797, was Bonaparte's decisive victory in the Italian campaign..."
