**Recommended** | 0 min playtime | Outcome: Victory — Cavalry Charge

## First Impressions
Opening narrative: 222 words (73% unique vocabulary).
The opening hooks you immediately. You feel the cold, you see the men beside you, you know the stakes. This is how you start a game.

## Pacing
- **Phase 1 (Line):** 12 clicks, 16s — drags. Too many clicks for a scripted tutorial.
- **Phase 2 (Charge):** 2s — 508 words of narrative. Good shift in tone.
- **Phase 3 (Melee):** 7s — 0% text repetition. Stays engaging.
- **Total:** 25s (0 min)

## Choice & Agency
- After Phase 1, stats: Morale 86, Health 100, Stamina 82
- 1 actions produced no visible change — felt meaningless
- Phase 2 narrative: 508 words of encounter text

## Narrative Quality
- Total words: 2998
- "FIRE!" count: 2 (ok)
- "White coat" count: 5 (fine)
- Melee text repetition: 0%

## What I Liked
- Opening is 222 words — draws you in immediately.
- Named characters in the opening — I already care about the guys next to me.
- Phase 2 narrative: 508 words — the parchment style feels different and more literary.
- Melee text variety: only 0% repeated — combat stays fresh.
- Ending: 153 words — satisfying conclusion.

## What Needs Work
- Phase 1 took 12 clicks and 16s. That's too much clicking before things get interesting. 3 volleys would be enough.

## Ending (153 words)
The ending matches the tone of the game. Satisfying conclusion.

## Would I Recommend?
Yes. Despite some rough edges, the atmosphere and character work carry it. Fix the repetition in melee and bulk up the endings, and this is easily an 8/10.

## Top 3 Recommendations
