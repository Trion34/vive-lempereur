## First Impressions
Opening narrative: 113 words (78% unique vocabulary).
The opening hooks you immediately. You feel the cold, you see the men beside you, you know the stakes.

## Pacing
- **Phase 1 (Auto-play):** 30s — 296 words of cinematic narrative.
- **Phase 2 (Story beats):** 31s — 208 words of parchment narrative.
- **Phase 3 (Melee):** 5s — 93% text repetition. Gets tedious.
- **Total:** 68s (1 min)

## Choice & Agency
- After Phase 1, stats: Morale 93, Health 190, Stamina 180/180
- Story beat choices: 3 options at Wounded Sergeant
- Phase 2 narrative: 208 words of encounter text

## Narrative Quality
- Total words: 1188
- "FIRE!" count: 1 (ok)
- "White coat" count: 15 (crutch descriptor)
- Melee text repetition: 93%

## What I Liked
- Opening is 113 words — draws you in immediately.
- Named characters in the opening — I already care about the guys next to me.
- Phase 1 auto-play: 296 words of narrative in 30s — cinematic and engaging.
- Wounded Sergeant story beat: 3 choices — meaningful decision.
- Fix Bayonets narrative: 208 words — the parchment style feels different and more literary.

## What Needs Work
- 93% of melee combat text is repeated — I'm seeing the same descriptions over and over. Needs more variety.
- Game didn't end after 15 melee rounds — feels like it dragged on too long.

## Ending (0 words)
The ending is a letdown.

## Would I Recommend?
Yes. Despite some rough edges, the atmosphere and character work carry it.

## Top 3 Recommendations
1. 93% of melee combat text is repeated
2. Game didn't end after 15 melee rounds
